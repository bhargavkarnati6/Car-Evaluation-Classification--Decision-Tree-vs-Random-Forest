🚗 Car Evaluation Classification — Decision Tree vs Random Forest (Custom + sklearn)

This notebook trains and evaluates three tree-based models on the UCI Car Evaluation dataset:
	1.	Decision Tree (sklearn)
	2.	Random Forest (sklearn)
	3.	MyRandomForest (custom implementation) — built using:
	•	bootstrapping (sampling with replacement)
	•	multiple DecisionTreeClassifiers
	•	majority-vote aggregation

The notebook includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and confusion matrices.

📌 Dataset
	•	Dataset: Car Evaluation (UCI)
	•	Source: Loaded using ucimlrepo (dataset id = 19)
	•	Rows: 1,728
	•	Features: 6 categorical features
(buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety)
	•	Target: class (4 classes: unacc, acc, good, vgood)

⚙️ What the Notebook Does

1) Load Data
	•	Fetches dataset using fetch_ucirepo(id=19)
	•	Separates features X and target y
	•	Plots class distribution (bar chart)

2) Preprocessing
	•	One-hot encodes all categorical features using pd.get_dummies()
	•	Splits into train/test with stratified sampling (80/20)

3) Train Models
	•	Trains a DecisionTreeClassifier
	•	Trains sklearn’s RandomForestClassifier
	•	Trains MyRandomForest (custom)

4) Evaluate

For each model, the notebook prints:
	•	Accuracy
	•	Classification report (precision/recall/F1)
	•	Confusion matrix plot

Finally, it prints a comparison table:
	•	Model name
	•	Accuracy

🧠 Custom Model: MyRandomForest

Your MyRandomForest class works like a simplified Random Forest:
	•	Bootstrapping: for each tree, sample n rows with replacement
	•	Train a DecisionTreeClassifier on each bootstrap sample
	•	Prediction: collect predictions from all trees and return the majority vote
	•	Also includes predict_proba() by averaging tree probabilities
